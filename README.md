# 📊 Customer Churn Segmentation & Prediction

A machine learning project to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and build an interactive web app for predicting customer churn using the **Random Forest** algorithm.

> ✅ Built with: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Joblib  
> 📦 Dataset: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

---

## 🔍 Project Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand churn patterns.
- **Preprocessing** including encoding categorical variables, imputing values, and scaling.
- **Segmentation** of customers using PCA for visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest (best performing)
- **Streamlit Web App** for interactive churn prediction.
- **Model Deployment** ready on Streamlit Cloud.
